## •Description
This application simulates Connect Four, a board game where the player who manages to make a row of four pieces in any direction first wins.

## •What i learned
It was a great (and challenging!) experience to unravel the logic of the game and come up with your own solution for it. I had difficulty doing equality comparison with objects, but I got a solution. Researching later, I found a library that does this type of comparison and I intend to refactor the code :)

## •Technologies and Libraries
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- React.js

## •How to run the application
- Clone the repository on your machine
- In the terminal, install the application's dependencies: ```npm install```
- Now just put the application to run!: ```npm start```
